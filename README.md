# csec380-lab10

This lab for Web Application Security involved finding an exploit on Exploit DB, replicating it, and for extra credit, Dockerizing it. This provides a good demonstration of a real-world example of RCE.

Link to exploit: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47044

Install instructions (after docker-compose up): https://docs.librenms.org/Installation/Install-LibreNMS/

Some of the instructions may vary depending on set-up and use.
